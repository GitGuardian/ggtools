## Application Topology

Here's a side-by-side table comparing the new GitGuardian architecture containers with the legacy architecture. This table highlights the changes in deployment names and their usage between the two architecture. You can also find architecture diagrams on [this page](https://gg-code.pages.gitguardian.ovh/public-docs/jouhannet-release-2024-3-0/self-hosting/new-architecture#a-more-scalable-architecture).
